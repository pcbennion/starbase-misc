Misc YOLOL scripts for use in the Starbase space sandbox videogame.

Each directory contains standalone YOLOL scripts. They don't really do anything by themselves and should be regarded as collections of formulas, algorithms, and snippets.

Anyone who comes across this repo is encouraged to copy and use anything they find useful.
